I'm a long-time Postman user but have now completely switched over to using the REST client for Visual Studio Code by Huachao Mao. It provides an easy way to capture API tests, whether ad hoc or a thorough integration test in a plain text file. This file can then be checked into source control along with your other artifacts and shared with the team.
